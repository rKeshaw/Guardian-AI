# Guardian-AI

[![Development Status: In Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in--development-orange)](https://github.com/rKeshaw/Guardian-AI)

Guardian-AI is an advanced, multi-agent AI-powered penetration testing and security assessment system. It is designed to automate and augment the entire security testing lifecycle, targeting the OWASP Top 10 (2023) vulnerabilities and beyond. **This project is currently under active development.**

## ðŸš§ Status
**Guardian-AI is a work in progress.** Features, APIs, and architecture are subject to change.

## Key Features
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Five specialized agents for reconnaissance, vulnerability analysis, payload generation, penetration testing, and reporting.
- **AI-Driven Workflows**: Each agent is powered by advanced language models, using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and persona-based prompting.
- **OWASP Top 10 Coverage**: Automated identification, exploitation, and reporting for critical web vulnerabilities.
- **Stealth & Automation**: Built-in stealth modes, anti-detection, and asynchronous execution.
- **FastAPI REST API**: Run scans, retrieve results, and monitor progress via RESTful endpoints.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Full system runs via Docker Compose, including dependencies (Ollama, Redis, etc).

```

- **ReconMaster**: Elite intelligence gathering & attack surface mapping
- **VulnHunter**: AI-driven vulnerability classification and risk assessment
- **PayloadSmith**: RAG-based payload generation for discovered vulnerabilities
- **ShadowOps**: Stealthy penetration testing and exploitation
- **ReportMaster**: Automated technical and executive reporting

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Python 3.11+ (for development/extension)

### Deploy with Docker Compose
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rKeshaw/Guardian-AI.git
cd Guardian-AI
docker compose up --build
```
- Guardian-AI API will be available at: http://localhost:8888
- Visit `/docs` for interactive API documentation.

### Usage
- Use the web dashboard or API endpoints to launch security assessments.
- Monitor progress via `/api/v1/scan/{session_id}/status`.
- Retrieve full results via `/api/v1/scan/{session_id}/results`.
